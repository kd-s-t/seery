**Seery** is a decentralized crypto prediction platform that combines AI-powered forecasts with on-chain staking to make market participation simple, transparent, and rewarding. Users can stake BNB on whether a cryptocurrency’s price will rise or fall within 24 hours, with all stakes and payouts recorded directly on the BNB Chain. The platform solves the problem of opaque prediction systems by using verifiable on-chain transactions and hybrid oracle feeds from Chainlink and Pyth for accurate, automated market resolution. Seery targets crypto traders, beginners seeking guided insights, and DeFi users who want transparent, trustless prediction markets enhanced by AI-driven analysis.



**Features:**

**Hackathon Core Requirements:**
- **BNB Chain Integration**: Full mainnet and testnet support for all on-chain transactions (Required)
- **AI-Powered Predictions**: OpenAI generates price predictions with direction and percentage change (AI Integration)
- **On-Chain Staking**: All stakes stored on blockchain smart contracts with individual stake tracking (Blockchain Integration)
- **User Interaction**: Modern web interface with wallet connection, market browsing, and staking (User Interaction)

**YZi Labs Preferred Track - AI-Assisted Oracles:**
- **AI-Assisted Oracle Integration**: Chainlink and Pyth Network oracles for faster, contextual price resolution (24h vs traditional 24-48h)
- **Hybrid Oracle System**: Chainlink for major coins (BTC, ETH, BNB), Pyth Network for altcoins (SOL, XRP, ADA, etc.), CoinGecko fallback
- **Auto-Resolution System**: Automated cron job resolves expired stakes using oracle price feeds without manual intervention
- **Reward Distribution**: Automatic reward distribution to winning stakers based on prediction accuracy

**Additional Features:**
- **24-Hour Prediction Window**: Each prediction expires after 24 hours for resolution
- **Multiple Stakers**: Support for multiple users staking on the same prediction (up/down pools)
- **Real-Time Market Data**: Live cryptocurrency prices from CoinGecko API
- **News API Integration**: Crypto news feed from TheNewsAPI for market context
- **User Profile**: Track wins, losses, net profit, and win rate
- **Admin Analytics**: Dashboard showing ongoing stakes, resolved stakes, unique stakers, and accuracy metrics

**Future Features:**
- **Buy and Sell**: Direct cryptocurrency trading functionality within the platform
- **Enhanced News Integration**: Multiple news APIs will be integrated to provide richer data feeds for OpenAI analysis, improving prediction accuracy and market context
- **Domain Separation**: Separate domains for mainnet and testnet deployments (mainnet.theseery.com and testnet.theseery.com)
- **Market Expansion**: Will venture into stocks, sports, esports, and other possible betting games

### Reward Distribution Scenarios

Seery uses a **proportional reward system** where winners receive their original stake back plus a proportional share of the losers' pool.

**Formula:**
```
Reward = Your Stake + (Your Stake / Total Winners' Stake) × Losers' Pool
```

#### Scenario 1: High Wins

**Stakes:**
- **High (Up):** 1 BNB (You) + 2 BNB (Person 2) + 5 BNB (Person 3) = **8 BNB total**
- **Low (Down):** 3 BNB total
- **Total Pool:** 11 BNB

**If High Wins - Reward Distribution:**

1. **You (1 BNB stake):**
   - Reward = 1 + (1 / 8) × 3 = **1.375 BNB**
   - Profit: **0.375 BNB** (37.5% return)

2. **Person 2 (2 BNB stake):**
   - Reward = 2 + (2 / 8) × 3 = **2.75 BNB**
   - Profit: **0.75 BNB** (37.5% return)

3. **Person 3 (5 BNB stake):**
   - Reward = 5 + (5 / 8) × 3 = **6.875 BNB**
   - Profit: **1.875 BNB** (37.5% return)

**Result:** All 11 BNB distributed. Winners get 37.5% return on their stake.

#### Scenario 2: Low Wins

**Stakes:**
- **High (Up):** 10 BNB total
- **Low (Down):** 1 BNB (You) + 2 BNB (Person 2) = **3 BNB total**
- **Total Pool:** 13 BNB

**If Low Wins - Reward Distribution:**

1. **You (1 BNB stake):**
   - Reward = 1 + (1 / 3) × 10 = **4.33 BNB**
   - Profit: **3.33 BNB** (333% return)

2. **Person 2 (2 BNB stake):**
   - Reward = 2 + (2 / 3) × 10 = **8.67 BNB**
   - Profit: **6.67 BNB** (333% return)

**Result:** All 13 BNB distributed. Winners get 333% return on their stake.

#### Key Points:

- **Proportional Distribution:** Larger stakes receive larger absolute rewards, but all winners get the same percentage return
- **Zero-Sum:** All funds in the pool are distributed (winners' stakes + losers' stakes)
- **Risk/Reward:** Smaller pools on the winning side result in higher returns for winners
- **Fair System:** Your reward is proportional to your stake size relative to other winners
