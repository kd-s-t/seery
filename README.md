# 🔮 Seer

Seer is an AI-powered prediction market platform on BNB Chain that uses AI to create markets from news and resolve them faster than traditional oracles. Unlike UMA's 24-48h optimistic oracle, our AI-assisted resolution provides near-instant results while maintaining accuracy through evidence-based analysis.

**Features:**
- **BNB Chain**: Mainnet and testnet support for all transactions
- **AI Market Generation**: Automatically generates tradeable markets from news articles
- **AI-Powered Resolution**: Resolves markets in minutes instead of days using OpenAI
- **On-Chain Settlement**: All bets and payouts settled on BNB Chain smart contracts
- **MetaMask Integration**: Seamless wallet connection for market creation and betting
- **Real-Time Updates**: Live market data and pool sizes
- **Revenue Model**: 2% platform fee on all winning bet payouts
- **Fully On-Chain**: All market data stored on blockchain (no database)
- **Smart Contract Testing**: Comprehensive Hardhat test suite
- **Docker Support**: Full stack deployment with docker-compose

Use cases for Seer include event prediction markets, news-based trading, sports betting, political predictions, crypto price predictions, and any scenario requiring fast, AI-assisted market resolution with on-chain settlement.

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Seer** is a decentralized prediction market platform that leverages AI intelligence with blockchain technology to create, manage, and resolve prediction markets faster than traditional oracle-based systems.

## 🏆 Hackathon Alignment

This project addresses several YZi Labs Preferred Project opportunities:

1. **AI-Assisted Oracles**: Faster resolution than UMA's 24-48h optimistic oracle
2. **Subjective Predictions**: AI can resolve subjective or multi-stage predictions
3. **Better UX**: Modern web interface makes prediction markets feel like normal apps
4. **Revenue Focus**: Platform fees create sustainable business model

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and npm
- MetaMask browser extension
- BNB Chain testnet BNB (for testing)
- OpenAI API key (for AI features)

### Installation

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kd-s-t/seer.git
cd seer
```

**2. Install all dependencies:**
```bash
# Backend
cd expressjs
npm install

# Frontend
cd ../nextjs
npm install

# Smart Contracts
cd ../bnb
npm install
```

**3. Set up environment variables:**

Backend `.env` (in `expressjs/` folder):
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
PORT=3016
NETWORK=testnet
BNB_TESTNET_RPC=https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545
BNB_MAINNET_RPC=https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...  # Deploy contract first (see below)
PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key  # For automated transactions (optional)
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo  # or gpt-4-turbo for better results
```

Frontend `.env.local` (in `nextjs/` folder):
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3016
```

**4. Deploy Smart Contract:**
```bash
cd bnb
npm run compile
npm run deploy
```

Copy the deployed contract address to your expressjs `.env` file.

**5. Start Services:**

Terminal 1 - Backend:
```bash
cd expressjs
npm start
# or for development with auto-reload:
npm run dev
```
The backend runs on `http://localhost:3016`

Terminal 2 - Frontend:
```bash
cd nextjs
npm run dev
```
The frontend runs on `http://localhost:3015` and automatically opens in your browser

## 📖 Usage

### Creating Markets

1. **Manual Creation:**
   - Connect your MetaMask wallet
   - Enter a question (e.g., "Will Bitcoin reach $100k by end of 2024?")
   - Add outcomes (comma-separated, e.g., "Yes, No")
   - Set duration (1-168 hours)
   - Click "Create Market"

2. **AI-Generated Markets:**
   - Click "🤖 Generate with AI" button
   - AI will suggest markets based on current news
   - Review and create the suggested market

### Placing Bets

1. Browse active markets
2. Select an outcome
3. Enter bet amount (minimum 0.001 BNB)
4. Click "Bet"
5. Confirm transaction in MetaMask

### Resolving Markets

Markets can be resolved:
- **Manually**: By the market creator after the end time
- **AI-Assisted**: Use AI to suggest the winning outcome
- **Automatically**: After end time (if configured)

### 📝 Project Description (150 words)

**Seer** is a decentralized prediction platform on BNB Chain that uses AI to create markets from news and resolve them faster than traditional oracles. Unlike UMA's 24-48h optimistic oracle, our AI-assisted resolution provides near-instant results while maintaining accuracy through evidence-based analysis. The platform automatically generates tradeable markets from current events, allows users to bet on outcomes, and uses AI to suggest resolutions based on verifiable facts. All bets and payouts are settled on-chain with a 2% platform fee. The modern web interface makes prediction markets accessible to non-technical users, addressing the UX gap in current DeFi prediction markets. Revenue is generated through platform fees, creating a sustainable business model.
